# HomeAutomationAPI
School project for Operating Systems/Linux. We're making a Home Automation system that integrates many smart devices. From the Philips Hue bridge to smart plugs to even custom IR controllers. 

#Components
- Registry service (REST API which contains all registered controllers)
- Controller services (controls the smart devices and exposes an REST API for our clients)
- Clients (Android/Desktop/Web? for now)
